      <h3>Goal Alignment</h3>
      <p class="p-summary">
        The goal of my website is to express who I am as a designer. I want it to be clear, accessible, and warm. I’m not just showcasing work—I’m building an environment where someone can get a feel for my perspective. Every decision, from type to tone, is part of telling that story.

      <h3>Possible Style Designs</h3>
      <p class="p-summary">
        This is my initial design direction. While I like the warmth, I plan to further enhance it with the full palette. At first, it felt too flat and didn’t evoke the sense of depth I was going for. But these sketches gave me a place to start. They helped me visualize what a more refined version might look like if I played with hierarchy, scale, and balance more intentionally.

      <h3>Fonts – Readability and Legibility</h3>
      <img src="../Images/Blogs/Fonts.png" alt="Font Samples" />
      <p class="p-summary">
        ‘Grown’ is used for headings to add personality, and ‘Montserrat Classic’ for body text due to its readability. Together, they allow contrast between character and clarity. I wanted headings that felt expressive but not overwhelming, and body text that would hold up across long paragraphs and mobile views. The font pairing feels modern but personal—exactly what I needed.

      <h3>Colours – Theory and Application</h3>
      <img src="../Images/Blogs/Colour palette.png" alt="Full Colour Palette" />

      <h4>Primary Colour Palette</h4>
      <img src="../Images/Blogs/Colour palette 1.png" alt="Primary Colour Palette" />
      <p class="p-summary">
        I chose warm, analogous colors (yellow, orange) for harmony and unity. These shades set the tone for the entire site—they feel energizing but soft. I wanted the site to feel like morning light—inviting and optimistic, not sterile or cold.
      </p>

      <h4>Secondary Colour Palette</h4>
      <img src="../Images/Blogs/Colour palette 2.png" alt="Secondary Colour Palette" />
      <p class="p-summary">
        Secondary colors (blue/orange) add contrast and visual balance as complementary tones. The blue gives the palette structure and calmness, helping to ground the more energetic tones. I use them strategically to emphasize buttons, links, and hover effects.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="inspiration-block">
      <h3>Composition – Hierarchy, Balance, Harmony</h3>
      <p class="p-summary">
        The site is symmetrically laid out and center-aligned. Circular motifs and rotational repetition support visual harmony. I used grids to guide my layouts, but I was flexible enough to break them when needed for visual rhythm. It was a balancing act between precision and personality.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="inspiration-block">
      <h3>Shape, Colour, and Position</h3>
      <p class="p-summary">
        Rounded and circular buttons align with my goal of creating a soft, inviting design. Sharp corners didn’t feel right for the vibe I wanted. Curves communicate friendliness, so I made that a core feature across navigation, cards, and call-to-actions.

            I admire the use of circular shapes to create a soft, welcoming atmosphere. The layout felt intuitive and organic, which is what I wanted for my own site. It showed me that UX can feel natural and calming without losing clarity.

            This helped me choose my palette. Warm colors evoke excitement and are effective in user engagement and brand identity. It gave me the confidence to lean into oranges and yellows, even though they’re not often used in minimal web design.
