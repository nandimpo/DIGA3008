    <h2> My Web Design Process!</h2>

    <h3> Documentation of your IxD process</h3>
    
    <p> Goal Alignment: The goal of my website is for users to understand who I am as a designer. I would also like my website to be user friendly. There it will be clear, understandable and accessible.I would like my website to be warm , welcoming and inviting</p>

    <h3> Style process documentation</h3>
     <p> Possible designs: This is my initial design. I like the warm colors; however, I have not yet implemented both the primary and secondary color palettes. The design is not as warm as I would like. In the future, I want the website to feel warmer.

    <h3>Fonts</h3>
    <p>I choose the ‘Grown’ font for the header because it is interesting yet legible.I chose ‘Montserrat Classic’ as the body text because it is more legible and readable. </p>

 <h3> Colours - Colour theory and relationships</h3>

 <p> Colour Palette</p>
 <img src="../Images/DesignProcess/Colour palette.png" alt="Colour Palette" width="500" height="300" aria-label=" Colour palette for web design">

 <h4> Primary colour palette:</h4>
<img src="../Images/DesignProcess/Colour palette 1.png" alt="Primary colour palette" width="500" height="300" aria-label=" primary colour palette for website">
<p> I chose warm colours because they are inviting. Also yellow and orange are analogous colours. Also these colours create a sense of harmony and unity that's pleasing to the eye.
</p>
<h4> Secondary colour palette: </h4>
<img src="../Images/DesignProcess/Colour palette 2.png" alt="colour palette 2" width="500" height="300" aria-label=" secondary colour palette">
<p>I chose colours in the secondary colour palette to contrast the primary colour palette to create a sense of balance. Orange and blue are complementary colours as well. If these colours are used together they enhance visual appeal and make elements stand out. 
</p>

<h3> Composition - Hierarchy, Balance, Harmony</h3>
<p> My composition is symmetrical and centre aligned to create a sense of balance and harmony. Additionally I have repeated the circular elements and I have used rotation and reflection especially on the blog and portfolio screen.
</p>


<h4> Interface elements - visual representations (Shape, colour, position) </h4>
<p>I want circular and rounded shapes so they align with my design goal of creating a welcoming and warm website.</p>

<img src="../Images/DesignProcess/Button 4.png " alt="Button 4" width="500" height="500" aria-label=" Image of a web button" >

<h3> Reference Material </h3>

<p> I like the use of circular shapes and design that create a welcoming and soothing environment.

<p>This website helped me to choose a warm colour palette because as the website says:</p>

    <li>Emotional Impact: Red, orange, and yellow evoke happiness and excitement, strengthening user-content connections and building brand loyalty.
    </li>
    <li>Attention-Grabbing: These vibrant hues highlight important elements like CTAs, improving conversions and user engagement.
    </li>
    <li>Welcoming Environment: Warm tones create inviting atmospheres that encourage longer visits and build trust.
    </li>
    <li>Brand Identity: These colors convey energy and friendliness, establishing cohesive visual identities that resonate with target audiences.</li>
