      <h1>Documentation of my IxD Process</h1>
      <p>This page outlines the thinking and design principles I applied to create my website. It’s not just about how it looks, but about how it works and feels to use. Everything was intentional—even the smallest elements had a reason behind them.</p>

      <h3>Goal</h3>
      <p class="p-summary">
        My goal is to have a user-friendly, accessible, and clear website that reflects who I am as a designer. I didn’t want something flashy for the sake of it. I wanted something that felt like an extension of how I think—warm, calm, intentional, and easy to understand. I kept asking myself: if someone only spent 30 seconds on my homepage, what would they take away?
      </p>

      <h3>Visual Design Elements</h3>
      <p class="p-summary">
        I aim to create strong typographic hierarchy using the ‘Grown’ font for headings to convey a soft, feminine tone, and ‘Montserrat Classic’ for body text for clarity. I also maintain a limited color palette with brown (to embrace identity), orange and yellow (for warmth), and cool accents (for contrast). I experimented with layout spacing, margins, and alignment until the page started to feel like it had rhythm—not just blocks of content, but a conversation.
      </p>

      <h3>Fonts – Readability and Legibility</h3>
      <p class="p-summary">
        Choosing fonts was harder than I expected. I didn’t want it to feel generic, but I also didn’t want it to be hard to read. After testing a few options, ‘Grown’ felt expressive enough to give my site character, especially in titles. It almost feels handwritten without being messy. For body copy, I stuck with something clean and versatile—Montserrat Classic. It holds up well across different devices and screen sizes, which is super important for accessibility.

      <h3>Colour Swatches</h3>
      <p class="p-summary">
        This is the full palette I used throughout the site. I wanted to stick with earthy and warm tones, mainly because I don’t see a lot of brown being used in web design, and I wanted to challenge that. I paired it with accent tones like golden yellow and dusty orange to add life and highlight areas for user attention.
      </p>

      <h4>Primary Colour Palette</h4>
      <img src="../Images/Blogs/Colour palette (chosen 1).png" alt="Primary palette" width="200" />
      <p class="p-summary">
        The primary palette is warm and soft. These are the base tones I use the most—brown for depth and grounding, and muted yellows/oranges for energy and brightness. I was really cautious about making sure none of the colours felt too harsh on the eyes.
      </p>

      <h4>Secondary Colour Palette</h4>
      <img src="../Images/Blogs/Colour palette (chosen 2).png" alt="Secondary palette" width="200" />
      <p class="p-summary">
        The secondary palette helps break things up and guide attention. I mostly use these for contrast and balance—things like CTAs or hover states. It gives the layout some dimension without feeling overwhelming or disjointed.
      </p>

      <h3>Final Design Sketches</h3>
      <p class="p-summary">
        These sketches were super helpful for me to think through layout without jumping straight into code. I tried a few different structures and page orders until something felt right. I didn't want every page to look the same—but they still needed to feel connected.

      <h3>Wireframes – Content Mapping</h3>
      <p class="p-summary">
        Content mapping helped me make sure every page had a clear purpose and that the flow made sense. I moved a few things around to make better sense of the user’s journey—from homepage to specific areas like scripts or portfolio. Every section has to earn its place and guide the visitor.

      <h3>Implementation Notes</h3>
      <p class="p-summary">
        These are the choices I made while building the final site. Some were visual, others functional, but they all came from testing, reflecting, and reworking areas that didn’t feel quite right.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>I created a hierarchy where screen titles appear first, center-aligned for balance.</li>
        <li>Bright yellow buttons are used to draw attention to interaction points.</li>
        <li>Cards on the blog page highlight on hover for interactivity.</li>
        <li>Scrolling allows easy navigation through longer content.</li>
