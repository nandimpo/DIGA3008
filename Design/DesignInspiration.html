     <h1>Design Inspiration</h1>
     <p>A collection of styles, layouts and visual approaches that inspired this project.</p>

 <div class="design-content">
   <div class="inspiration-block">
     <p class="p-summary">Kristen Bateman</p>
     <img src="../Images/DesignProcess/Design Inspo 1.png" alt="Inspiration 1" />
     <p>I like the large headings.</p>
     <p>What really stands out to me here is how Kristen uses typography to create hierarchy. The oversized headings immediately grab your attention and make it clear what's most important on the page. I think this works because it follows the principle of progressive disclosure - you see the big idea first, then you can dive deeper if you want to. The clean, minimal approach also appeals to me because it doesn't overwhelm the user with too much information at once. This kind of bold typography choice communicates professionalism while still being approachable, which is exactly the balance I want to achieve in my own work.</p>

   <div class="inspiration-block">
     <p class="p-summary">Hannah Jacobs</p>
     <img src="../Images/DesignProcess/Design Inspo 2.png" alt="Inspiration 2" />
     <p>I like the spacing and alignment of the animations.</p>
     <p>The grid system Hannah uses here really catches my eye because of how organized everything feels without being rigid. The consistent spacing creates this visual rhythm that makes it easy to scan through all the different portfolio pieces. I appreciate how she's applied the gestalt principle of proximity - related elements are grouped together, which helps your brain process the information more efficiently. What I find particularly clever is how she manages to showcase diverse content types while maintaining visual consistency. This is something I want to incorporate into my own portfolio because it prevents that overwhelming feeling you get when there's too much visual chaos on a page.</p>

   <div class="inspiration-block">
     <p class="p-summary">Jennifer Fernandez</p>
     <img src="../Images/DesignProcess/Design Inspo 3.png" alt="Inspiration 3" />
     <p>I like the way the blogs are organised.</p>
     <p>What I really like about Jennifer's blog organization is how she's made complex content feel approachable and digestible. The card-based layout works brilliantly because each blog post becomes its own little world that you can quickly scan and decide whether to engage with. This follows Jakob Nielsen's usability principles about giving users control over their experience - you're not forced to read everything, you can pick and choose what interests you. I think this approach is particularly effective for content-heavy sites because it prevents that overwhelming feeling when you're faced with walls of text. The way she balances imagery with text also creates visual interest while keeping everything functional, which is exactly the kind of user-friendly design I want to achieve.</p>

   <div class="inspiration-block">
     <p class="p-summary">Zachary Jordan</p>
     <img src="../Images/DesignProcess/Design Inspo 4.png" alt="Inspiration 4" />
     <p>I like the use of colour and blocking.</p>
     <p>Zachary's use of color blocking really impresses me because it shows how color can do more than just look pretty - it becomes a functional tool for organizing information. The way he uses contrasting colors creates these distinct zones that help you mentally map out the interface. I find this approach particularly smart because different colors carry different visual weight, so you naturally know where to look first. It's like having a visual wayfinding system built right into the design. What I also appreciate is how this technique seems to follow accessibility guidelines while still maintaining a strong visual identity. This kind of purposeful color use is something I want to incorporate because it shows how design decisions can serve both aesthetic and functional purposes.</p>

   <div class="inspiration-block">
     <p class="p-summary">Alex Smith</p>
     <img src="../Images/DesignProcess/Design Inspo 5.png" alt="Inspiration 5" />
     <p>I like the use of colour.</p>
     <p>Alex's color choices really resonate with me because they demonstrate how thoughtful color application can create both emotional connection and functional clarity. I think the palette he's chosen likely taps into color psychology to evoke specific feelings and create memorable brand associations. What I find particularly effective is how consistent color use throughout the site reduces the mental effort needed to navigate - you start to associate certain colors with certain types of content or actions. This strategic use of accent colors provides emphasis without overwhelming the main content, which shows real restraint and purposeful decision-making. For my own projects, I want to achieve this balance where color serves multiple functions: creating hierarchy, establishing mood, maintaining brand recognition, and guiding user behavior all at once.</p>
