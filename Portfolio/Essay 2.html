    <h1>Essay 2 - The internet, geopolitics, and digital coloniality</h1>
    <p class="blog-date">13 June 2025</p>
    
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
  
    <p>How did Big Tech companies algorithmically colonize the Kenyan labour force?
This essay uses the case study of tech companies like OpenAI and Meta Platforms Inc. outsourcing their work to African countries like Kenya to demonstrate algorithmic colonization. Algorithmic colonization represents western tech monopolies' desire to dominate, control, and influence social, political, and cultural discourse, mirroring traditional colonialism. These algorithmic colonization efforts drive profit maximization at any cost, treating the human soul, behaviour, and action as free raw materials (Birhane, 2020).
</p>
<p> In 2024, reports surfaced about Meta Platforms Inc. and OpenAI's quest to make their platforms less toxic. OpenAI used outsourced Kenyan labourers earning less than $2 per hour. These Kenyan labourers sorted text snippets into labels. Much of that text came from the darkest corners of the internet and described graphic situations in detail, including child sexual abuse, bestiality, murder, suicide, torture, self-harm, and incest. Additionally, Time Magazine reported that workers faced poor conditions: companies constantly surveilled them, forced them to work nine-hour shifts, and refused them counselling (Perrigo, 2023).</p>
<p> Meta Platforms Inc. created similar conditions. More than 140 former Facebook moderators in Kenya have filed lawsuits against Meta Platforms Inc. Third-party outsourcing firms like Sama and Majorel employed these moderators—the same firms that OpenAI uses. They reviewed graphic content like the OpenAI workers and sorted it. Their work proved essential to Facebook's operations because it ensured that the platform removed harmful content to maintain safety and reputation (Sanglay, 2025). Facebook moderators reported appalling working conditions, including low wages, inadequate psychological support, and a toxic workplace culture. The moderators also allege that companies often required them to sign non-disclosure agreements, preventing them from speaking out about their experiences (Sanglay, 2025).</p>
<p>This essay will illustrate how the internet, geopolitics, and digital coloniality facilitate this algorithmic colonization. It will also examine the intersectionality of these three aspects and how this intersectionality fosters algorithmic colonization.</p>

<h3>The Role of the Internet in Algorithmic Colonization.</h3>
<p>In the case of the Kenyan labourers who worked for OpenAI and Meta Platforms Inc., the internet played a key role in their algorithmic colonization. The internet functions as a worldwide computer network that connects local networks (Żarna, 2024). First, the internet connects these big tech companies to Kenya. The internet makes these jobs possible and provides the first avenue for algorithmic colonization. Companies advertised these jobs on the Sama and Majorel websites, and workers applied online, with these jobs specifically targeting young people (Sanglay, 2025). These posts reached thousands of people because of internet accessibility.</p>
<p>These jobs proved quite enticing for Kenyan youth because the unemployment rate reaches 67% (Sanglay, 2025). The internet allows these big tech companies to exploit highly unemployed youth. They can control whom they employ and at what cost, allowing them to maximize their profits. These patterns align with both traditional colonialism and algorithmic colonization.</p>
<p>The internet has created a digital divide between labourers in the global north and global south (Lutz, 2019). This digital divide operates on three levels and enables algorithmic colonization. The first-level divide concerns internet access, the second-level divide involves digital skills, technology uses, and online participation, and the third-level digital divide produces outcomes in the form of benefits and harms (Lutz, 2019).</p>
<p> In Kenya, for example, a news article reported that nationally 23.8% of households use the internet (Indeje, 2025). In comparison, in the United States of America, as Image 1 shows, 90% of households had internet access in 2022 (Taylor, 2023). The stark difference between Kenya's 23.8% household internet access and the US's 90% create fundamental vulnerability. Urban areas like those in the global north typically have higher digital literacy levels and greater adoption of digital technology, while rural and marginalized communities like those in the global south fall behind. This access gap means that when companies implement digital systems, they design them by and for populations with high connectivity, then impose them on populations with limited access and choice. This allows for worker exploitation because they may not understand the technology they work with and what they will do. This happened in Kenya: workers did not fully understand the technology they would use and what sorting and labelling the data truly entailed.</p>

<p> Furthermore, the first level of the digital divide leads to the second and third levels, which cause further exploitation and colonization. As established, the lack of internet access among Kenyan workers meant that they possessed fewer digital skills, making them vulnerable to control and exploitation by these big tech companies. This control manifests in the contracts and working conditions. The contract terms proved quite misleading and non-descriptive; for example, the posts promised $12.50/hour, but companies actually paid workers as little as $2/hour. Also, the posts did not mention the long hours—companies expected workers to work 12-hour days, 6 days a week. Additionally, companies crammed workers into small, poorly ventilated rooms and exposed them to noise and dust (Musau, 2023).</p>
<p> The second divide directly leads to the third-level divide, which produces outcomes in the form of benefits and harms (Lutz, 2019). In this case, the Kenyan workers did not benefit; through the first and second level divides, companies harmed them financially, emotionally, and physically. Meanwhile, big tech companies benefited greatly—they managed to make their websites safer at low cost. In this case, the internet played a major role in algorithmic exploitation because it allows big tech companies to exploit and control workers in the global south for profit. Ultimately, these tech companies used geopolitics to colonize the Kenyan labour force.</p>
<h3> The Role of Geopolitics in Algorithmic Colonization.</h3>
<p> Geopolitics played a significant role in the algorithmic colonization of Kenyan workers. Geopolitics analyses the geographic influences on power relationships in international relations. First, geopolitics concerns itself with influence and power over space and territory. Second, it uses geographical frames to make sense of world affairs (Dodds, 2019).</p>
<p>In this case, Kenyan labourers face a geopolitical disadvantage that facilitates algorithmic colonization. The big tech companies in the global north have more power and influence over labour in Africa because they produce more codified and transmittable knowledge, especially on the internet. This creates powerful forms of 'knowledge dependence' (Graham, 2014). Knowledge dependence represents the reliance of one entity on another for knowledge to complete a task or achieve a goal (Howard, Withers and Tihanyi, 2016). Knowledge dependence describes exactly what happened between the big tech companies and the Kenyan employees. The employees did not produce any new knowledge but relied solely on the prompts from the big tech companies for labelling. This made the workers solely dependent on these companies, thus giving the companies full control. This control allows these corporations to exploit the workers financially, emotionally, and physically, maximizing their profits. In the case of OpenAI and Meta Platforms Inc., these corporations use their geopolitical advantage to colonize the global south through their knowledge advantage. </p>
<p> Within geopolitics, internet geographies also exist. Internet geographies refer to the study of how the Internet and its infrastructure shape and are shaped by the physical and social world (Graham, 2014). Within internet geographies, data shadows represent the layers of digital information about places (Graham, 2014). The image below (Image 2) provides an example of a data shadow map. Additionally, digital divisions of labour represent the distinct and uneven geographies of the production of digital information (Graham, 2014). The image below shows an example of a map that displays the production of digital labour by showing where producers create the most Wikipedia articles.</p>

<p>As the image above shows, the global north produces most digital information geographically, and geographical knowledge, whether by design or unintentional consequences, has always connected with power (Graham, 2014). Representations of places, whether data shadows or digital divisions of labour, therefore, have and can exert power. This power appears in the case study of the Kenyan workers in big tech. In this case, big tech companies produced and owned the data that workers handled. These workers served as passive agents in the process. This allowed the tech companies to have power not only over the data and what workers did with it, but also over the workers themselves. This power enabled these companies to exploit these workers and their environment and exercise practices like colonialism, such as economic exploitation through their salaries and domination and suppression through the NDAs the workers had to sign. Ultimately, these tech companies used the internet to colonize the Kenyan labour force.</p>
<h3> The Role of Digital Coloniality in Algorithmic Colonization.</h3>
<p> Digital coloniality played a leading role in the algorithmic colonization of Kenyan workers. Digital coloniality represents a subset of tech colonialism and algorithmic colonization (Verdi, 2020).
Digital colonialism refers to the dominance and control that powerful entities (like big tech companies) exert over the digital sphere, specifically in developing countries. It includes the extraction and ownership of user data for profit, with limited benefits for the data source (Dahiya, 2023). Digital coloniality describes exactly what happened to the Kenyan workers, and it represents one of the mechanisms that OpenAI and Meta Platforms Inc. used to facilitate the algorithmic colonization of Kenya. In this case study, these big tech companies used the control they had over the digital sphere in a developing country like Kenya. They used their power and control to extract the workers' skills to sort and label the text. This extraction allowed them to market their data as 'safe' and thus drive up their profits. After this project, Time magazine reported that ChatGPT's creator, OpenAI, was in talks with investors to raise funds at a $29 billion valuation. This also included a potential $10 billion investment by Microsoft (Perrigo, 2023). This represented the benefit for the entity. However, the source of the data received limited benefits. Companies underpaid, overworked, and exploited workers.
</p>
<p>Digital colonialism can also manifest in unequal access to digital infrastructure, the imposition of technologies that do not suit local needs, and the shaping of digital narratives in ways that benefit the colonizer rather than the colonized (Dahiya, 2023). These manifestations occurred in Kenya. Companies subjected the workers to inferior digital infrastructure; they worked in environments that were often crowded and dusty (Sanglay, 2025). Additionally, these technologies did not suit the local needs of the communities as the employees required extensive hours of training. Finally, these big tech companies created digital narratives that benefited them. For example, OpenAI claims that they lifted 50,000 Kenyans out of poverty (Sanglay, 2025). Through this, we can see that digital colonialism not only facilitates algorithmic colonialism, but its manifestation creates further inequalities.</p>
<p> The Kenyan content moderation case shows how these workers exist within a complex digital ecosystem where they remain invisible, yet essential infrastructure. While OpenAI and Meta's platforms appear perfect to users in the Global North, they depend on a hidden layer of human labour that processes the disturbing content that algorithms cannot yet handle effectively. These workers have a precarious position in the digital ecosystem. They remain simultaneously indispensable for maintaining platform safety and completely disposable from a corporate perspective. Their labour allows 'clean' digital experiences that billions of users take for granted however they remain excluded from the benefits and protections that depict formal tech employment. This relationship shows how the digital ecosystem reinforces existing global inequalities, where the Global South provides the labour that sustains digital platforms while the Global North receives the economic and social value.</p>
<h3>The Intersection of the Internet, Geopolitics, and Digital Coloniality that Facilitate Algorithmic Colonization</h3>
<p> A clear intersection between the internet, geopolitics, and digital colonialism leads to algorithmic colonization. First, these three elements intersect because of the colonizer, which in this case represents the big tech companies. These companies use these elements, whether consciously or subconsciously, to exploit these workers in the global south. Without these big tech companies, this intersection would not exist.</p>
<p>Additionally, all these ideas contain an element of control and exploitation, thus creating an intersection. The big tech companies in this case have more control over the internet than employees do. Thus, they can control when the employees work, how they get paid, and what they get paid. Additionally, these entities have more geopolitical control than the employees do, thus they can control how much data they give to the employees, and they can control what happens with the completed data. Finally, digital coloniality operates through control and dominance, and this allows these entities to further exploit these workers. Ultimately, an intersectionality between these three elements surrounds power and control.</p>
<p> The final intersectionality involves algorithms and technology. The internet operates on algorithms. Additionally, data shadows and digital divisions of labour operate on algorithms as well. Finally, big tech companies use their algorithms and technology to exercise control over the global south. These elements connect through algorithms and technology and thus make algorithmic colonization possible.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p> In conclusion, the case study of OpenAI and Meta Platforms Inc. and the Kenyan employees provides an excellent example of how big tech companies exercise algorithmic colonization for profit. These companies employ strategies such as the internet, geopolitics, and digital coloniality to exercise control and dominance over their workers. This proves especially detrimental to workers in the global south because they face a severe disadvantage compared to these entities—not only do they not own the data they work with, but also the distance between them and these companies makes it difficult for them to express their concerns.</p>
<p> An intersectionality between the internet, geopolitics, and digital coloniality facilitates algorithmic colonization and creates even bigger digital divides. These interactions include control, exploitation, and technology.</p>
<p> The case study of the Kenyan employees in big tech shows how vulnerable the global south remains to algorithmic colonization and how dire the consequences are. The question remains: how does the global south combat this new form of colonialism?</p>
