    <h1>Essay 2: UX & UI Analysis of Ehomeaffairs</h1>
    <p class="blog-date">21 April 2025</p>
    
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Why should designers centre user interface (UI), user experience (UX), interaction design
(IxD) and ethics when designing websites? Websites need to have functional and ethical UI,
UX and IxD to be successful. These three elements are deeply connected and influence each
other in creating effective web design. When one component fails, it compromises another
component and affects the entire user experience.

<p>Using the Ehome affairs website as a case study, this essay will analyse how its design shows
the consequences when these components are not considered carefully. Ehome affairs shows
how poor UI decisions affect UX, which affects user interactions. This eventually leads to
ethical issues surrounding accessibility and usability. In examining these relationships, this
essay will show how successful web design requires attention to all three components and
their ethical impact. In the end the integral role of UI, UX, IxD and ethics in web design will
be understood. </p>

<h3>What is Ehome affairs?</h3>
Ehome affairs is a South African Department of Home Affairs website that allows South
African Citizens by birth to utilize online services. This website allows citizens to submit ID
and passport applications online, make online payment applications and make bookings
where allowed (Department of Home Affairs, 2025).
<h3>Analysis of UI of Ehome affairs  </h3>
<p>User Interface (UI) in a website refers to the website's appearance, interactivity, usability,
behaviour and the overall feel of the website (Hasan et al., 2024). It is usually the first thing a
user encounters and it can determine if the user has a positive or negative experience with the
website. Some of the core principles of UI are clarity, consistency and user control. </p>
<p>The Ehome affairs website does not successfully abide by all the core principles of UI
specifically consistency and user control (Nacheva, 2015). Consistency in UI involves all
elements on a website looking and behaving the same (de la Riva, 2021). On the navigation
bar all the links do not behave and look the same. For example, 'How to' and 'FAQ' links look
different to the four other links. The 'FAQ' page has a white navigation bar and 'How to' page
uses a different type of green and orange. Additionally, these links behave differently as they
take the user out of the website. Thus, the website is inconsistent in its functinality. To solve
this the external links should be distinguished visually using indicators like icons. </p>

<p class="p-summary">Image 2: The image displays a PDF titled ‘How to use eHomeAffairs’ for the South African Department of Home Affairs website.</p>
    <p>Also, this website does not afford the user a lot of control. User control means that the user
should never feel lost or frustrated. Additionally, the website must communicate what is
happening (Rosala, 2020). On the 'Logon' page below, once the user has completed the
information, they sometimes do not receive an OTP. Additionally, the website does not
communicate why this is happening. This reduces the amount of agency and control the user
has because without the OTP they cannot access the website. This leads to frustration from
the user thus negatively affecting the user's interaction with the website. To reduce this
frustration users should receive feedback as to why the OTP is not working or even a
secondary authentication method should be added.</p>

<p class="p-summary">Image 3: The image shows the South African Department of Home Affairs Ehome affairs
login page.</p>

<p>The Ehome affairs website is quite clear. The user sees the website and knows its purpose and
function. However, the clarity does not compensate for the lack of consistency and lack of
control. Thus making the UI of the inadequate.</p>

<h3> Analysis of the ethicality of the UI in Ehome affairs </h3>

<p>It is important for ethical UI to be accessible for all people. For UI to be accessible one must
consider equity and accessibility (Vaidya, 2020). Ehome affairs raises concerns surrounding
its visual accessibility.</p>
    <p>In terms of the colours and contrast ratio the Ehome affair’s website is not accessible. In the
image below, the light cyan/blue text is used for the Navigation bar, the 'Register' and 'Logon'
headings ,and 'Go to registration' button text. These elements do not have sufficient contrast
against the dark background. This makes the text difficult to read. This choice excludes users
with visual impairments thus creating an ethical issue of discrimination for what should be an
accessible government service. To combat this discrimination the text should be a darker
blue.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Ehome affairs logo and ID smart card are difficult to read in a high contrast
mode. As well as , the icons on the navigation. Thus, limiting the accessibility. To solve this
problem the icons should be a darker blue and the website should provide alternative text for
images.

<p class="p-summary">Image 4: High contrast image of Ehome affairs website.</p>

<p>Also, for ethical UI the user should be presented with multiple forms of navigation so they
can decide what is best for them (Vaidya, 2020). This includes options to search, link pages, a
table of contents or a site map. The Ehome affairs website only has one form of navigation
and that is the navigation bar. To solve this problem more navigation options should be
included.</p>
<p>Finally, the website does not accommodate for South Africa's eleven official languages. This
limits the number of people who can access it. An ethical UI design would use universal
design principles that aid all citizens. This is specifically important for government services
that all citizens have a right to access.</p>

<h3>Analysis of UX of Ehome affairs</h3>

    <p>User experience (UX) in a website is a quality aspect that considers the emotions that are
evoked by a system. This extends to the usability, effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction of
the website (Marques et al., 2021). The goal of UX is to make information easily accessible
for the user and it concerns itself with the user's motivation (Marques et al., 2021).</p>
    <p>There are best practices in UX that aid in usability, effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction
of the website. These laws include The Von Restorff effect, Hick's Law, Fitts' Law, Zeigarnik
Effect, and Serial Position Effect. The Ehome Affairs website does not foster effective user
interaction because it does not use these best practices effectively like the Von Restorff effect.</p>
<p> The Von Restorff effect or The Isolation Effect, predicts that when multiple similar objects
are present, the one that is different from the rest is most likely to be remembered (Yablonski,
2025). This can be done by highlighting important buttons, using contrasting fonts or colours
to draw attention and emphasizing key text or links using colour or bold. On the Ehome
affairs website below the primary colours are orange and black. The contrast to orange is blue
and there is no use of blue on the website. Thus, the lack of contrast makes everything on the
website feel unmemorable. To make the website more memorable more cooler colours should
be used.</p>
    <p> Additionally, on the website when a user hovers over text or links on the navigation bar
nothing happens. This makes everything on the website feel the same thus making navigation
difficult because nothing differentiates the navigation bar from the rest of the text. To
improve the UX the website should successfully use the Von Restorff effect by incorporating
hover states for all interactive components and the use of blue to contrast the orange.</p>
<p> </p>
<img src="../Images/Portfolio/Essay 5.png" alt="image from essay about e homeaffairs" width="500" height="300">
<p class="p-summary">Image 5: Navigation bar for Ehome Affairs website.</p>
<p> However, the website does use bold text on 'Register' and 'Logon' to emphasize their
importance. This makes these more memorable and draws the user's attention to them. This
makes the website more efficient because the user's attention is quickly guided to important
areas. Considering The Von Restorff effect, the website does not evoke strong feelings
towards the website because the website is quite monotonous and unmemorable. Thus the UX
is ineffective.</p>
<h3>Analysis of the ethicality of the UX.</h3>
<p>As well as UX being usable, efficient, and effective, it needs to be ethical. Ethical UX
involves creating designs that are transparent, autonomous and user centred (Aparna, 2024).
The Ehome affairs website is not ethical because it doesn't abide by these principles.</p>
<p>Firstly, the website outlines its goal is to allow citizens to submit ID and passport applications
online, make online payment applications and make bookings where allowed (Department of
Home Affairs, 2025). However, it is not possible for users to meet this goal because the OTP
function does not work and therefore, they cannot logon to perform these functions. When the
OTP function fails, users do not receive an explanation or alternative path forward. This lack
of transparency does not adhere to ethical principle of informed interaction. This is where
users should understand what is happening and why.</p>
<p> Finally, the Ehome affairs website is not diverse. The website does not cater for all differently
abled people. For example, if a user is blind, they are unable to input the CAPTCHA without
the assistance of someone else. To cater for blind people some websites have included a read
aloud function as seen on the image below. The lack of diversity is a grave ethical problem
because this is a government website that is meant to cater for all citizens.</p>
<img src="../Images/Portfolio/Essay 6.png" alt="image from essay about e homeaffairs" width="500" height="300">
<p class="p-summary">Image 6: Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX Captcha component demonstrating audio code
functionality, allowing users to hear the CAPTCHA text as an accessibility alternative to the
visual challenge.</p>
<p>The Ehome affairs does employ transparency as they provide a disclaimer to the user at the
bottom of the website. However, in the disclaimer they state that they cannot always
guarantee access to the website. This is an ethical failing because the acknowledgement that
the user’s needs are not a priority shows an abandonment of responsibility rather than true
ethical transparency</p>

<h3>Analysis of interaction design</h3>
<p> Interaction design (IxD) refers to the design of products that are interactive and can support
humans in their working activities and everyday life. IxD looks at how usable, easy and enjoyable these websites are to use (Moggridge, 2007). The interaction design is linked to the
UI because interface elements affect how users interact.
</p>
<p> The Ehome affairs' interaction is easy to use, however it is not usable or enjoyable because of
the UI. This website is easy to use because the user knows the function of the website,
additionally the user knows how many screens there are through the navigation bar. Also, the
important information is in bold and there is use of a variety of headers. This makes the
website easy to use and understand.</p>
<p> On the contrary the website is not usable or enjoyable. The user is not able to log on to the
website because they do not receive an OTP. This means that the user cannot access the
website and use it. This can conjure feeling of frustration. To solve this problem there should
be multiple delivery systems for OTPs like emails, SMS or an app. In terms of usability the
CAPTCHA system should be updated to include audio alternatives for the visually impaired.</p>
<h3> Analysis of the ethicality of Ehome affairs Interaction Desig</h3>
<p> Ethical interaction design addresses power dynamics and systemic consequences (Robertson,
2005). Ehome affairs' website interaction reinforces the power imbalance between
government and citizens. If a citizen cannot login into the page or bypass a CAPTCHA
without help the design limits their power. Also, there are no clear feedback channels or error
reporting methods on the Ehome affairs website. Thus, the user has little to no power if they
encounter issues with the design. If this interaction design was ethical, it would identify these
power imbalances and create systems to help citizens.</p>
<p> Also, ethical interaction design should enhance or support everyday life. The Ehome affairs
website does not enhance or support everyday life. Firstly, the user cannot interact with the
website daily because of the OTP not working. Secondly, if the viewer is visually impaired
the website does not support their daily life because contrast ratio of the website is not correct
in high contrast mode. Additionally, if the user is blind the UI does not facilitate them
entering the captcha without the aid of someone else. Thus, the interaction design of Ehome
affairs has a myriad of ethical issues because it does not support and enhance everyone's
everyday life.</p>
<h3> Conclusion</h3>
<p> In conclusion, the analysis of Ehome affairs' UI, UX, IxD shows the weaknesses of the
website's functionality and ethical position. This essay demonstrated how to create an effective website the designer needs to consider UI principles such as consistency and clarity
to create and facilitate good and ethical web design. The failures of the Ehome affairs website
highlight how Government websites specifically should build bridges to essential services ,
and not make them harder to access. In future government websites should prioritize
accessibility, usability, and ethical design practices.</p>
<p>To end, for Ehome affairs to better its web design and overall experience, the designers need
to start considering how they can make the website more functional by fixing the OTP
functionality, more accessible by adjusting the contrast ratio and more usable by increasing
the navigation. Finally, the designers need to assess the ethicality of their disclaimer.
Although the website says they will not put the user first does not negate their ethical
obligations to always consider the user. In future South African designers should always put
users first.
