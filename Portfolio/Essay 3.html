    <h1>Reflection on Website</h1>

    <h3>How My UX and UI Design Heavily Impacted My Code.</h3>
    <p>
      My UX and UI design decisions fundamentally shaped every aspect of my codebase, from the overall architecture down to specific implementation details. The user experience I wanted to create directly influenced how I structured my folders, wrote my markup, organized my styles, and implemented functionality. This design-first approach affected my Folder Structure, Semantic Markup, Metadata, CSS, and JavaScript in significant ways.
    </p>

    <h3>Folder Structure</h3>
    <p>
      I believe my folder structure reflects the hierarchical information architecture of my content and directly supports the user journey I designed. I separated my folders into different concerns like HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, which mirrors how users mentally categorize different types of content and functionality on the site. This separation also aligns with my UX goal of making the site feel organized and intuitive to navigate.
    </p>
    <p>
      My folder structure also allows my website to be modular and scalable, which was crucial for the expandable portfolio and blog sections I envisioned. By organizing files logically, I can easily add new projects or blog posts without disrupting the existing structure. This modularity also supports my UX principle of consistency - users can expect similar layouts and functionality across different sections because the underlying code structure supports that uniformity.
    </p>

    <h3>Semantic Markup</h3>
    <p>
      I feel I do provide sufficient context and information to the browser for screen readers and accessibility tools, which was a key UX consideration from the start. However, there are some places I could have added more semantic richness, particularly in my blogs and portfolio sections where the content hierarchy could be clearer for both users and assistive technologies.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do think my interface elements are expressed fully and correctly using appropriate HTML5 semantic elements like <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>. This wasn't just about code cleanliness - it directly supports the user experience by providing clear content landmarks that help users understand where they are and how to navigate efficiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can definitely use semantic markup to improve accessibility in my blogs and portfolio sections. For example, adding more descriptive headings, using <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> for project images, and implementing proper <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> elements for blog dates would create a more inclusive experience that aligns with my UX goals.
    </p>

    <h3>Metadata</h3>
    <p>
      I do think there's sufficient metadata to guide the browser in interpreting my content, especially the Open Graph tags and Twitter Card data that ensure my portfolio pieces look professional when shared on social media - a key part of my intended user experience for potential clients discovering my work.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have also identified what required metadata is missing, and this includes more descriptive alt text for images and captions for videos. My UX research showed that users often rely on these elements not just for accessibility, but also for context when viewing projects on slower connections where images might not load immediately.
    </p>

    <h3>CSS</h3>
    <p>
      I did avoid inline styles and used external CSS files to create consistent styling throughout the website, which supports my UX goal of visual coherence across all pages. Some of my stylesheets load quite late, like the main.css, so this might impact the perceived performance and create flash of unstyled content (FOUC) that degrades the user experience. However, I do think that most of my CSS is modular and maintainable, with clear naming conventions that reflect the UI components they style.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have different responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and devices, using CSS Grid and Flexbox to ensure the user experience remains optimal whether someone's viewing on mobile, tablet, or desktop. But my home page doesn't respond the way I want it to - specifically, the hero section becomes cramped on smaller screens and doesn't maintain the visual impact I designed for. This is an area where my UX vision isn't fully realized in the code yet.
    </p>

    <h3>JavaScript</h3>
    <p>
      I am expressing interaction points and functionality using JavaScript through event handling and DOM manipulation, focusing on the micro-interactions that make the interface feel responsive and engaging. I did avoid inline scripting and properly linked to external JS files, which keeps the code maintainable and allows for better caching - both important for the smooth, fast experience I wanted users to have.
    </p>
    <p>
      I used async requests (fetch API) for loading blog posts and portfolio data to reduce reloading and improve performance and UX. This creates the seamless, app-like experience I was aiming for, where users can browse different sections without jarring page refreshes. The loading states and error handling I implemented also ensure users always know what's happening, even when network conditions aren't ideal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The JavaScript also handles the smooth scrolling navigation and progressive disclosure of content that's central to my UX design - revealing information gradually as users explore rather than overwhelming them with everything at once.
