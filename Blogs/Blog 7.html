<p class="p-summary">I chose the Ehomeaffairs website because it is one of the most difficult websites to navigate.

      <h4 class= "p-name">Pros:  </h4>
    <li> It is a very simple website to navigate and the information is easy to understand.</li>
    <li>It is also intuitive to navigate. It feels familiar because the navigation bar is at the top which creates a hierarchy. Also the navigation bar is in a different colour.</li>

    <h4 class= "p-name">Cons  </h4>
    <li> The user controls are difficult to navigate. The website often does not communicate with the user appropriately. When you have to enter the OTP it consistently does not work.</li>
    <li>The website is not always operable at times when you request OTPs it does not work.</li>

    <img src="../Images/Blogs/Afa website.png" alt="Wireframe-Images" width="500" height="300" aria-label=" This is a style guide">
    <p class="p-summary"> I chose the AFA website because I like the use of colour throughout the website.
    </p>

    <h4 class= "p-name">Pros:  </h4>
    <li>The website has a video on the homepage which alerts the user what its function is and what it is about.</li>
    <li> The typography is readable and legible. The fonts on the website are easy to read and understand.</li>

    <h4 class= "p-name">Cons  </h4>
    <li> The website is not clear. There is not a section on the homepage that alerts the reader what AFA means and what it stands for.</li>
    <li>The website is very busy and there is a lot of emphasis on animations. The user is not aware where they should focus because their animations are running at the same time.</li>
