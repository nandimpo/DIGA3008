      <h1 class="p-name">Blog 10 - How I incorporated JavaScript into my website</h1>
      <p class="blog-date dt-published" datetime="2025-05-12">12 May 2025</p>

      <p class="topic-label"><strong>Topic:</strong> When thinking about how our code matters in the context of decolonialism, can you identify any things in your own coding practice that you should be aware of?</p>

      <p class="p-summary">Decolonialism is a political philosophy that means to include all elements incurred in the colonial experience, whether political, economic, cultural or psychological. It went further to argue that decolonization fundamentally meant the rejection of the civilization of the white man (Smith, 2023). In the context of code, it is considering how colonialism affects how we code and trying to rectify those consequences. In terms of code, algorithmic colonialism is driven by corporate agendas (Birhane, 2020). Corporate agendas use algorithmic colonialism through the need to dominate, monitor, and influence social, political, and cultural discourse through the control of core communication and infrastructure mediums. Also, there is a capitalistic agenda to make money. Therefore, this means creating code that will appear high up in the algorithm to make money. Therefore, this code is not designed according to design principles or justice. Additionally, there is code that is embedded in the technology that surveils people. Finally, colonial code does not consider context or the people it is designed for. It applies western norms and principles without consideration for the people (Birhane, 2020).</p>

      <p class="p-summary">For me to make code that considers the context of decolonialism, it is important to go against the norms of colonialism. This includes making code for the context and not for profit. This would include designing code for a South African context. For example, there are many in South Africa who do not have internet access. Therefore, designing the code to be as user-friendly and easy to navigate is a way that I can decolonise my code. Additionally, creating and designing code with justice in mind is a form of decolonialism in code. This could include making code that is disability-friendly. This can include implementing ARIA for visually impaired people, as well as ensuring the contrast ratios are disability-friendly.</p>

      <p class="p-summary"><strong>What changes have you had to make to your website to incorporate JavaScript?</strong></p>
      <p class="p-summary">The main changes I have made using JavaScript are advanced navigation and responsive design. In terms of navigation, I have used JavaScript to create search bars and menus to make navigation easier for my user. Additionally, in terms of responsive design, I have used CSS and JavaScript to create navigation menus that allow my website to adapt to different sizes and devices. This is important for maintaining a consistent and user-friendly experience across all platforms.</p>

      <p class="p-summary">Additionally, I chose to create separate JavaScript files and then incorporate them into my CSS and HTML files. Adding JavaScript did not heavily affect my HTML files because I simply had to add a reference. However, my CSS files have been adjusted quite a bit to accommodate my JavaScript. For example, if I had used CSS for navigation, I had to remove it and apply the JavaScript file instead.</p>

      <p class="p-summary"><strong>How does that help you streamline your interaction design?</strong></p>
      <p class="p-summary">The main benefit I have seen with JavaScript is that it makes the interaction design easier for the user. It allows the user to easily interact with the design by allowing them to easily find what they are looking for. This can be through search bars or menus. However, I find that at times it's difficult to implement JavaScript because you can't add too much because it will slow down the website. Although it does streamline the interaction design, it needs to be used effectively in order for it to be user-friendly.</p>
