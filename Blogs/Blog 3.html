<h3> Topic:Working through the slides for Interaction Design for the web, define and discuss your user alignment, and map out your site's content, experience, and interface elements.
</h3>

<h4>User Alignment: </h4>
    <p>  User alignment involves the user and the goal of a website. In terms of the user, it is what I want the user to see, do, and who they are. My website is for anyone who wants to learn about my design process and my ability to communicate easily and effectively through the web. I want them to navigate through my pages easily and see that I can design well. </p>
      
      <h4> Siteâ€™s content:</h4>

    <img src="../Images/Blogs/Mapping-Sites Content.png" alt="Wireframe-Images" width="500" height="300" aria-label=" This is an image of a content mapping of a website">
    <p>The content of my website showcases my knowledge of the web, and what I can do in terms of design , communication , functionality and my portfolio. </p>

    <ul> 
        <li>
            <li>Blog posts - showcases my understanding of the web and internet. </li>
            <li>Design - showcases my design process clearly and effectively as well how and why I have made specific design choices on this website.</li>
            <li>Scripts - showcases my ability to understand the functionality of web design. </li>
            <li>Image- showcases my aesthetic choices. </li>
            <li>Portfolio- showcases my additional skills for example animation , design and writing. </li>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Experience</h4>
    <p> Mapping</p>

    <img src="../Images/Blogs/Mapping- Experience.png" alt="Wireframe-Images" width="500" height="300" aria-label=" This is an image of a experience mapping of a website">
    <p>I would like the user experience to be practical and useful. The user should feel the website is easy to navigate and from any page they can always easily navigate to content. I would like the user to be able to easily scroll and click through the website.
    </p>

    <h4>Interface Elements:</h4>
    <p> I would like the website to be appealing , easy to use and the interaction should be intuitive so the viewer is not confused by what to do. To achieve this I am going use:</p>
    <ul>
            <li> Input controls : There will be headings on the homepage for all the content (blog posts, portfolio, images, scripts, design).</li>
            <li>Navigation components : 
                <p>- On all the content pages there will be sliders so the viewer can navigate up and down the page.</p>
                <p>- Each blog post will have a button for each so they can be opened. </p>
                <p>- I would also like to incorporate a search field on the homepage.</p>
                <p>- The portfolio  page will have headings for the animation, design and writing pages. </p>
                <p>- For the images they will be presented in a list and each image will have a button. </p>
                <p>- The scripts page will have icons for each script type.</p>
                <p>- The design page will have different headings for UI, UX, Wireframes and Design process.</p>
            </li>
    </ul>
     <h4> Information controls: </h4>
     <p> I would like to incorporate message boxes for each content page that explains what the page is and how to navigate it. For content pages that require reading like the blog posts and design, I would like to incorporate progress bars so the viewer can see how much they have read.</p>

     <h4> Reflection</h4>
     <p> The exercise above depended on my understanding of semantic markups in HTML. I was aware of headings but I did not know how to use input controls like buttons, navigation commands like sliders, and information controls like message boxes. This exercise has helped clarify my URL scheme by making it more practical and useful.</p>
