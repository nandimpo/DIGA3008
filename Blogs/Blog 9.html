      <h3>Topic: Write a critical reflection on one of the readings provided. This week, we will be doing a reflective reading. The process is the same as a close reading, but instead of answering what they are saying, you interpret what they are saying and relate it to your own critical framework.

      <p class="p-summary">I chose this reading by Magenya because I thought it was interesting and the reading I could relate to.</p>
      <p class="p-summary">This text explores the importance of African feminists on the internet. Magenya highlights that African feminists are important because firstly they provide alternative narratives to those that are peddled by western media. Secondly, African feminists can and do create safe spaces for other African minorities to exist and feel seen. Finally, they will change the perception of Africans (Magenya, 2020). Also, Magenya notes that post-Covid, the Internet is mimicking the real world. It is becoming more western, conservative, and heteronormative. She suggests the solution to this is the inclusion of African feminists on the Internet (Magenya, 2020).</p>
      <p class="p-summary">I firmly agree with the points made by Magenya, especially when it comes to the Internet mimicking the real world. Since this article was written, the world has become more conservative. There has been a rise in Catholicism in Asia and Africa (Sarr, 2025). This means that more liberal views and perspectives are being sidelined. As a result, feminist voices get lost, specifically African feminist voices. This seeps into the internet and affects the voices we hear. Therefore, it becomes increasingly important for African feminists to have their voices heard and provide an alternative voice to conservatism.</p>
      <p class="p-summary">There are various other topics Magenya explores that I agree with. The first is that she writes that the internet and other communication technologies have become lifelines for many people (Magenya, 2020). This is a valid observation because, since this article was written, more jobs have been created on the internet (Flynn, Fischer, 2025). Since the pandemic, jobs in the digital marketplace have spiked. This means that not only are people relying on the internet for social connections but they rely on the internet to support them financially. Therefore, it becomes increasingly more important to have diverse voices because if not, the internet will mirror the real world even more and those who get hired online mimic those who get hired in the offline world - men, and Europeans. This is where African feminists come in. As echoed by Magenya, they can use their voice to advocate for diversity in the online workforce.
</p>
      <p class="p-summary">Another point that Magenya makes is that technology has pushed online as well offline where the online realities and upcoming issues do not have offline processes and recourse (Magenya, 2020). Magenya uses the example of online gender-based violence. If someone experiences attacks and bullying because of their gender online, there isn't enough recourse and measures someone can take offline to mitigate this, especially in Africa where the laws about technology and internet are adapting in real time. This is where African feminists come into place. According to Magenya, these feminists create a safe place online for women and this is why they are important. I found this point particularly interesting and important because gender-based violence is an ongoing problem in South Africa, and African feminists can help mitigate this problem online and offline.
</p>
      <p class="p-summary">The final point that Magenya makes that I think I agree with is the danger of a single story. A single story is one version or side of a story with the omission of the other perspectives. Magenya notes that this commonly happens with African stories because narratives are shaped by big media companies which are usually owned by the global north (Magenya, 2020). Therefore, when stories are told by media companies, they are often told from one side which is usually western or one-sided. This is where the single story comes in because the stories are not told from an African perspective. This is where African feminists come in. They can tell the other side of the story that is often not represented and provide perspective on the stories of African minorities.
