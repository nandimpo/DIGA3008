    <p> The goal of my website is for users to get an insight into who I am as a designer. I am very passionate about the environment and my identity as an African and black person, so I wanted my website to reflect elements and colours in nature so visually the user can get insight into who I am as a designer. Also, I incorporated the colour brown because it reflects who I am. It is also a colour I think people think can be quite dull but it's actually quite interesting and diverse. I chose very circular shapes so it's friendly and inviting. Circular shapes are quite feminine and warm; this is also another reason why I chose these shapes.
    </p>

    <h4> Reflection of original wireframes: </h4>
    <p> My original wireframes don't really hold up to my current vision because the shapes are angular and linear. I would like to incorporate more circular shapes to communicate the theme of warmth and friendliness. Also, I would like to incorporate more centred alignment. If possible, I would like a more nested visual information structure because it feels more friendly. Also, I would like to incorporate more progress bars on all my screens because people remember incomplete tasks more. I would like to keep the same navigation because it is very easy to understand.</p>

    <h4> Reflection on my work for Website 1: </h4>
    <p> I struggled with folders and referencing the folders specifically with absolute and relative referencing. I struggled initially because I would alternate between the two. I eventually mastered relative referencing with my folders. I struggled with zen coding as well. I am proud that I eventually got the hang of zen coding. I am also proud of the navigation on my website and how my pages are linked. I am also proud of the way my information is organised on my blog. In the future, I would like my navigation to be more seamless. Therefore, I would like to incorporate more anchor links and more videos and interactive content to make it more interesting visually.
