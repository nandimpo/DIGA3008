      <h3>Reflections of my work and Ideas/</h3>
      

      <p class="p-summary"> After implementing my CSS, I wasn't too happy with my design. The overall aesthetic felt disconnected and lacked the visual impact I was aiming for. Therefore, I did more research on websites that have similar designs to mine and similar color schemes. Brown is not a color that is used often in web design, which initially made me hesitant about my choice. However, I found inspiration from the website below that completely changed my perspective.</p>

      <p class="p-summary">On the website above, I liked that brown was a central color and they didn't shy away from using brown prominently throughout their design. The way they balanced warm browns with complementary tones created a sophisticated and earthy feel that I found really appealing. This gave me confidence that brown could work as a dominant color if executed properly. I'm thinking of adding more brown and incorporating it more cohesively throughout my design, perhaps using different shades and tones to create depth and visual interest.</p>
      <p class="p-summary">I also didn't like my homepageâ€”everything felt very out of place and disconnected from each other. The layout seemed random rather than intentional, and the visual hierarchy wasn't clear. So I thought of changing the design to the wireframe below to create a more cohesive layout that would better guide users through the content and create a stronger first impression.</p>

      <p class="p-summary">Additionally, I'm thinking of changing my design and portfolio pages so they are more in harmony with each other. Currently, they feel quite disjointed, and it seems like the website isn't one cohesive site but rather separate pages thrown together. The inconsistency in layout, typography, and visual elements creates a jarring experience when navigating between sections. I'm planning to redesign my portfolio and design pages so all the pages work together as a unified whole, creating a seamless user experience that reinforces my brand identity throughout the entire site.</p>
