        <h2>Blog Post 2</h2>
       <time datetime=" 24 February "></time>
       <h3> Topic: Reflect on Moulthrop, S. (2003) ‘You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws of Media (1991)’.</h3>
        
       <p>This text resonates with the internet quite heavily. A lot of the claims in the text seem to be predictions for what the internet would and has become. For example, the text discusses hypertext and Ted Nelson's project Xanadu. Project Xanadu would be a repository and a central network for all writing (Moulthrop, 2003). This would make text accessible to anyone and everyone on Xanadu.
    </p>
    <p> A lot of other creators seem to have been inspired by this. For example, Audible which allows most people on the internet to listen to books at a fee. Another example is Substack, which allows anyone on the internet to read free essays or subscribe to someone's page so you can read all their essays.
    </p>
    <p> The text also lists various issues related to hypertext that are relevant to the internet today. The text expressed the political ramifications that are associated with hypertext that people are not necessarily concerned about (Moulthrop, 2003). This resonates with the internet today as people are not concerned with the political ramifications of the internet. For example, the idea that the internet can sway elections, and there haven't been measures put in place to prevent this.
    </p>
    <p> Another interesting point I found in the text that resonates with the internet today is that the author mentions that after hypertext, people will be looking to the next innovation (Moulthrop, 2003). This is reminiscent of the internet today where people are always looking for the next big thing; this could be an app, a new development, or website.
    </p>
    <p>There is only one part of the text that doesn't speak to the internet today, and that is the part where bookstores and libraries would be dead and everything that is text-related would become electronically stored (Moulthrop, 2003). In fact, the opposite has happened, and as recently as 2020, there was a resurgence of independent bookstores (Raffaelli, 2020). So this is the only part that doesn't necessarily speak to the internet today.</p>

    <h3>Folder structure and URL scheme.</h3>
    <p>I will have 5 five folders: </p>
    <h4>Homepage </h4>
    <p> This is the landing page. It will feature an about me section and explain who I am. I want it to be a video so it's more interactive. I will also have all my folders at the top to make them easily accessible. I was inspired by The Diigitals homepage because it's very clean, clear, and interactive.</p>
