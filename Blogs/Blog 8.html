      <h3>Topic: Respond to at least two of the articles in the Research: Internet, Society and Design Justice section.</h3>
      <p class="p-summary">Pick one that appeals to you. You must engage critically with the reading and do more research where required.</p>

      
      <p class="p-summary">I chose the text by Sasha Costanza-Chock because it focuses on community-led practices to foster design justice. This resonates with me because I believe the more diverse opinions there are in design, the better it is because it caters to more people.</p>
      <p class="p-summary">The section of this text that intrigued me was about the millimeter wave scanner interface. The text recounts how the author had to go through one of these machines at the airport. The author describes how, because they are femme-presenting, the operator of this machinery usually selects female. However, because they are non-binary, the machinery flags the genital area as an anomaly. The people who design this machinery assume that all people have a gender identity that is consistent with the one they were assigned at birth (Costanza-Chock, 2020). Therefore, this machinery only accounts for cisgender males and females. It will flag any variations that are not programmed into it. As Costanza-Chock describes, if the operator selects male, there should be no three-dimensional contours detected in the chest area. If an anomaly is detected, the person is flagged and a physical search is conducted. This is indeed what happened to the author, and further complications arise from this because who should conduct physical searches for non-binary people?</p>
      <p class="p-summary">This instance presented by the author interested me because it links back to the concept of ethical design. Ethical designs are designs for everybody - they are inclusive, diverse, and accessible (Mok, 2023). Therefore, ethical design provides justice for all. The millimeter wave scanner is an example of unethical design. This design does not cater to everybody because it only accounts for cisgender males and females. Therefore, if an individual does not fall into these categories, it can lead to an uncomfortable and unnecessary physical search. There is an easy solution to this problem: the design should account for non-binary people. As proposed by Costanza-Chock, if the people who designed this machinery were a community of diverse individuals of different genders, races, and sexual orientations, this would mitigate the discomfort and embarrassment brought on by this design. Costanza-Chock also proposes that the UI should provide other selectors besides male and female to mitigate this problem.</p>
      <p class="p-summary">I also enjoyed Costanza-Chock's text because it brings awareness to the Design Justice Network. They are a community of design practitioners like designers, journalists, and developers whose goal is to rethink design processes and center people who are usually marginalized (Costanza-Chock, 2020). Their goal is to address the deepest challenges our communities face. This community resonated with me as a marginalized individual. There are many instances where I have interacted with designs that do not cater to me. For example, when I have used Pinterest in the past, I would search for "nail designs" and the hands that would appear would be white **as seen below**. Therefore, I would have to search "nail designs for black women." This negatively affected my user experience because the application did not feel diverse or inclusive. This is why the Design Justice Network resonated with me because I believe in the same design goals. Additionally, Costanza-Chock discussing their work creates awareness of their mission, thus they can reach more people.</p>
