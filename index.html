        <p class="p-summary">I am Nandi Mpofu. I love art by Black women, especially from Africa. I grew up surrounded by their books and music. I want to share this art with others so the world can appreciate Black women's creativity as much as I do.The goal of my website is for users to understand who I am as a designer. I would also like my website to be user friendly. There it will be clear, understandable and accessible.
